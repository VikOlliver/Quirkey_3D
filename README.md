# Quirkey_3D
OpenSCAD models for the parts of a Quirkey chord keyboard

This revision features captive keys that do nto require glueing on like the earlier versions. The base now has pillars that hold the microswitches and keycaps, with slots added so that the entire wiring harness can be installed and removed without having to solder or unsolder any wires. The shell is now hollow, with manually-added support panels so that the whole thing prints without any support material (at least on a Prusa Mk3). The thumb and control key have been combined into one component.

Note: This is still work-in-progress. It fits together and works but is not yet optimised.
